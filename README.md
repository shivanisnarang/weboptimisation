#### Part 1: Optimize PageSpeed Insights score for index.html

To improve the pagespeed score, i have inlined the font and style css files and put the 'async' tag on Google analytics JS file and therefore reducing CRP to one. I used ImageMagick to compress the images "views/images/pizzeria.jpg" and "img/profilepic.jpg" and used Grunt tool and its plugins to minify all of the necessary files to reduce the amount of bytes that needed to be downloaded.

#### Part 2: Optimize Frames per Second in pizza.html

To optimize views/pizza.html, you will need to modify views/js/main.js until your frames per second rate is 60 fps or higher. You will find instructive comments in main.js. 

You might find the FPS Counter/HUD Display useful in Chrome developer tools described here: [Chrome Dev Tools tips-and-tricks](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/tips-and-tricks).
